  <h1>gfxCardStatus v2.2.1</h1> 
  <div id="container"> 
    <div class="header"> 
      New in this version: 2012 + Retina MacBook Pro support!
    </div> 
    <div class="content"> 
      <ul> 
        <li>Fixed the issue with Integrated Only where quitting some apps would
          cause the discrete GPU to activate. Integrated Only mode now tricks
          OS X into thinking that you're not using a machine with automatic
          graphics switching, so it never attempts to switch GPUs on you.</li>
        <li>A huge ground-up rewrite of almost the whole app that <strong>shouldn't
            require an update to work with new hardware in the future.</strong></li>
        <li>Now localized in 21 languages! English, Danish, French, German,
          Italian, Spanish, Swedish, Czech, Greek, Finnish, Latvian, Dutch,
          Polish, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Slovak, Turkish,
          Ukranian, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese.</li>

      Known Issues
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <ul>
        <li>Plugging in external displays while on Integrated Only doesn't work.
          I'm still doing some research to see if it's possible to detect when
          a display is plugged in while on Integrated Only.</li>
        <li>Power source-based switching is still a liiiittle finicky when you
          plug in/unplug while asleep sometimes.</li>
      </ul>

      Thanks!

      shape or form. You're all awesome.
